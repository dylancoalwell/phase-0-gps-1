What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the concept of when to make commits and when to merge branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
When to commit and merge branches were clarified to me as well as how to fix conflicts.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my pair basic questions about syntax while we were doing the challenge. I asked the guide questions about when to commit and how often we should commit.

What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still a bit shaky on the Github side of it all but I'm going to study it more on my own.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great! My pair is a nice guy and we work well together. I learned a lot from him as well as my guide.
